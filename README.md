### What is this repository for? ###

data2viz is a data visualization library for several platform:browser, jvm, android, ... It relies on kotlin which
 compiles on these platforms.

data2viz proposes to develop data visualizations through a completely typed DSL. It simplifies the programmation by 
helping developer with IDEâ€™s suggestions based on the current context.


### Current status ###

data2viz is in its early age. It should not be used in production now. We are experimenting various DSL
 implementations. DSL should be validated after having implemented all the use cases which will take few months.
